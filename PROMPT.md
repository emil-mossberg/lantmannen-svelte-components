# PROMPT TEMPLATE 

Iâ€™m working on a Svelte 5 application that is integrated into an existing Adobe Commerce / Magento 2 storefront. The Svelte app is not using SvelteKit, but is instead built as a standalone frontend that is embedded into Magento pages to take over specific UI functionality.

Key features implemented in the Svelte app include:

Fetching price and stock levels dynamically via AJAX

Handling the purchase flow, including selection of configurable options (size, color, etc.), validation, and triggering the "Add to Cart" action

I will provide:

The complete codebase in a single file

A local copy of the Svelte 5 documentation, since this version was released after many LLM cutoff dates

Please answer the following question with that context in mind:
